                I love travelling especially road trips. I enjoy much the bike rides on long empty roads in cooler weather conditions. Here I would like to post details about some of the recent trips that I had.

                The plan was pretty imprompto one. Had called a friend on Saturday evening to meet for a coffee as it had been quite a time we had talked. The call somehow turned into a trip the next day 6:00 AM. We were on the way to Nandi Hills. Once you leave the Bangalore city traffic, you get a good high way where you can ride from 80-100 km/h for quite a long time. Then, you get roads through villages and forests which is the best rides in the whole journey. Once you reach at the top of Nandi Hills, you could get a good view of the village near by. They do have paragliding facilities at the top and we were able to see paragliders. However, was not able to find the base camp. Overall it was a pleasant experience.
